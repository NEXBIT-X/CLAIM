            <p class="features-text">
              Protect your ideas before they‚Äôre stolen
              Traditional patent systems are expensive, slow, and out of reach for many creators. CLAIM offers a smarter way.

              Not a legal patent, but powerful proof
              By minting your idea as an NFT on the blockchain, CLAIM gives you a tamper proof, timestamped record proving the idea was yours              first.

              Transparent, fair, and open
              CLAIM works on decentralized networks like Polygon and IPFS so no middlemen, no hidden fees, and full public visibility.

## 🚀 Overview

**CLAIM** is a decentralized platform that provides **government-verified patent uploading platform**.  
By leveraging **Ethereum blockchain** and **Pinata (IPFS)**, CLAIM ensures that patents are:

- **Tamper-proof**
- **Properly indexed**
- **Future-proof and globally discoverable**

> ⚠️ **Important:** Only patents officially verified by government authorities can be submitted and minted on CLAIM.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Government Verification Required**  
  Only patents confirmed via official databases (e.g., IPO India, WIPO) can be added.  

- **📂 Indexed & Permanent Storage**  
  Patents are stored on **Pinata (IPFS)** with cryptographic hashing for easy retrieval and long-term accessibility.  

- **⛓ Immutable Blockchain Proof**  
  Ownership, metadata, and timestamps are stored permanently on **Ethereum**.  

- **🌐 Public Innovation Network**  
  Verified patents are showcased publicly for visibility, collaboration, and credibility.  

- **🛡 Transparent & Auditable**  
  Anyone can verify the authenticity of patents directly via blockchain data.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet (MetaMask)** – Authenticate via Ethereum wallet.  
2. **Submit Patent Details** – Upload PDF and metadata.  
3. **Government Verification API** – Cross-checks and verifies authenticity.  
4. **Mint Patent NFT** – Creates an immutable record on Ethereum.  
5. **Store on Pinata (IPFS)** – Files are stored and indexed permanently.  
6. **Public Display** – Verified patents appear on the CLAIM platform.
